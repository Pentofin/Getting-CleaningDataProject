# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Week-4-Assignment

1. Downloads all required data files into the R working directory.
2. Call the dplyr package.
3. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set (for X data, y data and Subject data).
4. Extracts the measurements on mean and standard deviation using the grep command to get column indices for variables with the names "mean()" or "std()".
5. Names the activities in the newly created data set with descriptive names. This was done by converting activity labels to characters and then adding a new column as a factor.
6. Labels with descriptive variables names were matched with the dataset. Descriptive names were then matched with variable columns.
7. From step 5, a second independent tidy data set with the averages of each activity and each subject was created.
